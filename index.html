                                On March 29, 2005 Grey's Anatomy debued on ABC.  Show runner Shonda Rhimes created a fun and dynamic nightime medical drama set in the fictional hospital "Seattle Grace" in  Seattle, Washington.  From the first episode I was obsessed with the stories of Meredith, Alex, George, Izzy and Christina (MAGIC!) and have seen all 400 episodes.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>As a graduate student I used an assigned project as an excuse to re-watch the first seven seasons in order to answer the question "Are you more likely to live or die if you are a patient at Seattle Grace?"  But in the course of working on the project I noticed some interesting trends regarding race and gender that I decided to pursue.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>This analysis demonstrates some of these findings answering the following questions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Did the show demonstrate gender bias?</li>
                                <li>Did the show demonstrate racial bias?</li>
                                <li>Did the show demonstrate racial diversity compared to real world populations (US and Seattle)?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4 class = "mb-2">Methodology</h4>
                            <p>Data was collected by watching all seven seasons and determining gender and race for the 529 patients that appeared in 148 episodes.  A potential margin of error could exist as the data collected was based on one person's observations. Both race and gender were ascertained by how the cast member appeared to present themselves in each episode.  Only patient data was collected, if they were a friend or family member of the patient they were not counted. Series regulars were also not counted. Thus these numbers do not reflect  the total number of people who may have appeared in each episode.  Analysis of Race is not based on total patients as it only includes Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino and White.  These four categories had a significant number of patients from which to draw conclusions. Analysis of Gender is also not based on total patients as a small portion of patients gender could not be ascertained.  US and Seattle Race percentages came from US Census data.</p>

                            <p>Initial research in GOZ_ESG_Analytics.ipynb used data for all 15,644 companies in order to get an understanding of the data, determine what questions might be asked and how they would be presented. Once a direction was determined, ESG_Analytics_for_Food_Related_Sectors.ipynb focuses the research and conclusions specifically on food related sectors comprising of 745 companies. Specifically: Retail - Food & Staples, Beverages, Food Products, and Restaurants.</p>
                            <p>Visulations and conclusions are limited by the data only contains the final ratings for each company. Questions asked, how data was weighted to come to the overall score, and any other factor the company takes into account when determining company ratings were not available.</p>

                    <p>In my personal time my favorite thing to do is travel. I am always looking to have new experiences in new locations. From 2017 to 2020 before Covid hit I had the good fortune of traveling to Spain, England (3 times), Ireland, Scotland, France, Wales and Dubai.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I am also fortunate to live in the Los Angeles area, a city that offers an incredible number of activities so there is no chance to be bored. Whether it be hiking, visting friends, or going to the movies, plays, concerts or other events there is no shortage of fun things to do locally.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>And you can't forget having the requisite season pass to Disneyland (the happiest place on earth)!</p>
